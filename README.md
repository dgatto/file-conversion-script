# README

		The purpose of this script is to solve an issue where conventional text editors (Word, Notepad, even Excel) force the user to
		save an '.msp' file as a text-only file. This causes errors with LipiDex. This script simply allows the user to find and
		replace any and *all* given instances of a phrase in a file of their choosing, but doesn't save the file as text-only.
